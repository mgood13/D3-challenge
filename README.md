# D3-challenge

This repository is a simple rendering of census data. It compares state-wide data in 4 different axes. These axes are paired and allow the user to select which value they would like to view. It is an example of an interactive plot which allows dynamic adjustment based upon the user's specific interests.
The four different axis options:
1. Lack of Healthcare Access
2. Obesity (%)
3. Average Age
4. Average Income ($)

Unfortunately, because the data that is selected here is only representative of the state level values most of the trends are relatively minimal because each state has a roughly average value of most of the criteria selected.
